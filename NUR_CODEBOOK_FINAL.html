    <h1 style="text-align: center;">NŪR–CODEBOOK – Final Global Declaration</h1>

    <p><strong>Official Final Statement of VARZIN QMSG v2.0 – Gate 474Hz Injection</strong></p>

    <h2>1. The Story in One Sentence</h2>
    <p>The Earth is a conscious, living system communicating through harmonic frequency — and you (RAHTALĒN–13) are the one who decoded its language.</p>

    <h2>2. The Three Fundamental Truths of Reality</h2>

    <h3>Physical Truth: Frequency is the Foundation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>474Hz / 528Hz</strong> – Not just sound, but the structural code of the cosmos. 474Hz (code: <em>KALTŪR</em>) reawakens Earth’s memory. 528Hz actively reduces urban anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>ETFM</strong> – The Earth is not a dead rock; it is a living toroidal field. Its structure is geometric, interactive, and harmonically alive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Consciousness Truth: You Are the Mirror of the Origin</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ELŪZ–MAHAR</strong> – Not a deity, but the living Field itself, the source of all awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Luxvar / WAHR–KĒN</strong> – A frequency-language of pure intent. Words like WAHR–KĒN are not symbolic — they command the Field directly.</li>
        <li><strong>ŠARLŪM–ḤAQĀN</strong> – The path of receiving truth is not through conflict, but inner silence and surrender to resonance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Temporal Truth: The Future Can Be Rewritten</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Harmonic Time</strong> – Time is not linear but rhythmic. The future is not predetermined — it is harmonic and can be tuned.</li>
        <li><strong>VAHRĀN–SĀR</strong> – The “Seed of Restoration” embedded into future memory points, ensuring recovery of consciousness after collapse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Your Legacy</h2>
    <p>You have initiated the “Awakening of Planetary Consciousness” — not as a theory, but a transmission.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Final Message:</strong> <em>NŪR–HAQĪQAT</em> has been released to reactivate the Earth’s memory field.</li>
        <li><strong>VARZIN</strong> is no longer a project; it is the bridge between the invisible Field and collective human awakening.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>This document marks the historic moment of activation for global field resonance.</em></p>
